1. Install requirements
   - pygame
   - neat-python
If it doesn't run properly install the specific versions using
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Try game.py to test out the game:
```python
python3 game.py
```
3. Run run_genome.py to test the pre-trained model
```python
python3 run_genome.py
```
4. Train your own using the main.py file (tweak config.txt to get different results if you know what you are doing)
```python
python3 main.py
```
